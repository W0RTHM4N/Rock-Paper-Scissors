# Rock Paper Scissors
My 7th Python project from Hyperskill.

This is a classic game, where the user chooses its weapon and then it's compared with randomly chosen computer weapon.

The first input is a player's name. If the user's name exist in a rating.txt file, the user's score is being set to the value from file. (rating.txt must exist always)

The second input is a set of available weapons, separated with ",". If the second input is empty, the weapons are set to classic rock, paper and scissors.

The third and furter inputs are considered as users weapons, except the following commands:
- !rating - shows the user's current score;
- !exit - stops the game and exits the program.

The program doesn't write the new user's score to a file.
